  "summary": "Most core UI requirements appear implemented: single-page structure with 5 sections, wine/cream alternating Section wrapper with pattern overlay classes, romantic typography, in-view fade animations, editable love letter with copy, editable memories with add/edit/copy and clipboard image paste, and a reasons grid with icons. However, the diff does not provide clear evidence that the required generated image assets exist/are used for both cream and wine pattern overlays, and it adds several unrequested features (Internet Identity/react-query actor plumbing, lucide-react icon dependency usage, and a marketing footer attribution).",

      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Add required generated images as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and use them in the UI for subtle background pattern overlays and romantic decorative accents (without routing images through the backend).",
      "reason": "The diff shows a reference to the gold icon set image in ReasonsSection, but does not show any added files under frontend/public/assets/generated, and the pattern overlay classes (pattern-cream/pattern-wine) are not shown referencing the required pattern PNGs. Since some added files were omitted/truncated, existence/usage of both required pattern images cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",

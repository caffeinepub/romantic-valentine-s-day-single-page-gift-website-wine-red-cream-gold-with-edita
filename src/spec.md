# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a romantic, luxurious single-page Valentine’s Day gift website with a consistent wine red/cream/gold theme and on-page editable content for a love letter and memories.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single-page layout with 5 sections in order: Hero (“To the Love of My Life” + subtitle), editable Love Letter (editor + styled live preview + “Copy letter”), editable Memories grid (add/edit title + description, paste clipboard image into a card, per-card “Copy” for text), “Reasons I Love You” (icon-accented romantic items), and a final closing quote ending with the exact text “by vkayyy”.
- Apply consistent visual design: deep wine red + soft creamy white with subtle gold accents, elegant romantic typography (script/serif headings + clean body), and alternating section backgrounds (cream/wine) with soft gradients, subtle pattern overlays, and rounded cards.
- Add smooth animations: gentle fade-ins on section entry and subtle hover/focus transitions for interactive elements.
- Add generated static image assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and use them for background pattern overlays and decorative accents.

**User-visible outcome:** A polished Valentine’s single-page site with editable love letter and memories (including paste-image and copy-to-clipboard actions), themed sections with romantic styling/animations, and a closing line that ends with “by vkayyy”.
